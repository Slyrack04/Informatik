		<h3 style="text-align:center">The following explanation comes up when you ask ChatGPT</h3>
		<p style="text-align:center;">Communism is a socio-economic and political ideology that advocates for the establishment of a classless<br>
			society where all property is commonly owned and resources are distributed based on individuals' needs.<br> 
			It envisions a system where the means of production, such as factories and land, are collectively owned<br> 
			by the community as a whole, rather than being controlled by private individuals or entities.<br>
			The central tenet of communism is the belief in the abolition of social classes, aiming to create a<br> 
			society where everyone has equal access to resources and opportunities. In this system, wealth and power<br> 
			are shared among all members, and the concept of private ownership is rejected. Instead, communism promotes<br> 
			the idea of collective ownership, where decisions regarding production and distribution are made collectively,<br>
			usually through a centralized government or a democratic process.<br>
			Proponents of communism argue that it offers a solution to social inequality, exploitation, and the<br>
			alienation of individuals from the fruits of their labor. By eliminating the profit motive and prioritizing<br>
			the welfare of the community, communism aims to create a more egalitarian and just society.<br>
			However, communism has been a subject of intense debate and criticism. Critics argue that it often leads <br>
			to authoritarian regimes, limiting individual freedoms and stifling dissent. Historical examples, such as<br>
			the Soviet Union and China under Mao Zedong, have raised concerns about the concentration of power, lack <br>
			of political pluralism, and human rights abuses.<br>
			It is important to note that communism, in its pure form, has never been fully realized on a large scale,<br>
			and various interpretations and implementations have emerged. Different countries and movements have adopted<br> 
			and adapted communist principles to fit their specific contexts, resulting in a wide range of outcomes and<br>
			ideologies associated with communism.<br>
			Overall, communism remains a complex and contested ideology, with both supporters and detractors offering<br>
			diverse perspectives on its potential benefits and drawbacks.</p>
